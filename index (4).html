        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science ⚖️</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Maribel Hernandez and I am a sophmore Political Science student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR).From an early age, I have been passionate about law, justice, and the impact that policy has on individuals and communities. My specific interest lies in Immigration Law, a field where I believe I can make a meaningful difference in the lives of those seeking new opportunities and stability in the United States. Growing up, I witnessed firsthand how immigration policies affect families, shaping their futures and opportunities. These experiences have fueled my desire to become an advocate for immigrant rights and navigate the complexities of immigration law to help individuals and families build a better future. Understanding the legal system and how policies shape immigration pathways is crucial, and my education in Political Science at UCR provides me with a strong foundation to analyze policies critically and apply them effectively in legal contexts. To prepare for my career, I plan to gain hands-on experience in the legal field by becoming a paralegal at an Immigration Law office. Working as a paralegal will allow me to immerse myself in the legal processes, assist attorneys in case preparation, and engage with clients facing real-world immigration challenges. This role will provide me with invaluable insight into the day-to-day operations of immigration law, including visa applications, asylum cases, green card processes, and deportation defense. Additionally, I look forward to developing strong research, writing, and client communication skills that will be essential in my future legal career. After gaining experience as a paralegal, I plan to attend law school and specialize in Immigration Law. My goal is to become an Immigration Attorney dedicated to advocating for those who need legal assistance in navigating the complex U.S. immigration system. Whether it is reuniting families, helping asylum seekers, or guiding individuals through the naturalization process, I want to be a resource for those who may feel lost in the legal system. Beyond academics and career aspirations, I am committed to staying involved in my community and advocating for social justice. I believe that understanding immigration law is not just about knowing statutes and policies but also about understanding the human stories behind each case. As I continue my studies at UCR, I aim to participate in internships, volunteer work, and organizations that support immigrant communities and provide legal assistance to those in need. In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am always eager to learn, grow, and challenge myself. Law is a constantly evolving field, and I am dedicated to staying informed about new policies, court rulings, and advocacy efforts that shape immigration law. I see my future in law as not just a career, but a lifelong commitment to justice, equality, and helping others achieve their dreams. I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to making a meaningful impact in the legal world.<br><br>

       I look forward to hearing back from any recruiters, thank you!<br><br>

        Recent Awards Honored include the Monica Florian Scholarship (2024-25) and graduating Summa Cum Laude in High School.
